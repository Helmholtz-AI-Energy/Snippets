## Advanced workspacing on HOREKA and HAICORE

All HOREKA workspaces are stored at `\hkfs\work\workspace\scratch` and HAICORE workspaces at
`\hkfs\work\workspace_haic\scratch`.
While not shown with `ws_list` all workspaces are accessible from both system at these paths.

Furthermore, snapshots of all workspaces can be found in `\hkfs\work\.snapshots`.
There are two snapshots for the last day, daily snapshots for the last week, and weekly snapshots for the last month.
Unfortunately, these seem to currently be aggressively deleted, when the workspace runs out.
