# Snippets
Useful code snippets. Anything which we can copy paste from project to project

# Organization
- `hpc+unix`: folder for things related to the HPC machines.
- `python`: folder for general python things.
- `nn`: folder for neural network related things
- `plotting`: folder for plotting related things

# File Names
Please give useful filenames and maintain some sense of organization!
i.e. plotting snippets go into a plotting folder

# Uncertainty
- the uncertainty of a set of measurements can be the std of the measurement points
- the plus/minus of it is HALF the std
- if you need to do calculaations with that uncertainty, the uncertainy needs to be propagated through the equation.
  - one can do this by hand, but it sucks. i recommend this: https://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/view.jsp?id=3df8a5c5bad0ce42dd15e6c408b11d28
